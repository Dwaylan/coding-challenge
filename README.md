Start with the us_companies_html_table.html file.
Add a feature that will allow the user the ability to "filter" the table by typing some text in a text box.
For example, if the user types "acxiom" into the text box, find a way to show the user the data that exists in the table that matches that term. You could hide rows that don't contain the word "acxiom", or highlight a row that contains the word "acxiom", or any other creative solution you define.
Finally, add some CSS to the page to make the table "look" a little bit better.
The point of this exercise is not one of completeness, but rather a simple proof of concept showing your basic understanding of HTML, Javascript and CSS. Use whatever framework you would like to accomplish this task.
